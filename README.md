# CompareSort
For this program, I compared the performance of the sorting algorithms I learned by implementing them and running them.

Implemented the following sorting algorithms:
• MergeSort
• HeapSort (in-place)
• InsertionSort (in-place)
• SelectionSort(in-place)
• BubbleSort

Analyzes the algorithms empirically by generating and sorting many arrays of random integers, and covers a wide-range of array sizes.
